Hi My Name is Adnan,

Small Description of my project:-

* The Hospital Management System project aims to streamline the operations of a medical facility through the integration of technology. 
Leveraging core Java collections and an Oracle database, this system efficiently manages various aspects of hospital administration.

* Core Java collections provide robust data structures and algorithms for handling complex data scenarios efficiently. They enable the 
implementation of features like patient records and appointment scheduling.

* The Oracle database serves as a reliable and scalable repository for storing critical information such as patient details and doctors details.
It ensures data integrity, security, and accessibility for authorized personnel.

**Key features of the Hospital Management System include:**
1. **Patient Management:**
       Allows registration, updating, and tracking of patient information and appointments.
2. **Appointment Scheduling:**
       Facilitates the scheduling of appointments for patients with doctors and other medical
       professionals, ensuring efficient time management.
